			purpose = <"To record the result of assessment made by Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD), a score developed to screen for pediatric delirium.">
			use = <"Use in critically ill pediatric patients aged 0-21 years to identify delirium. As in adults, hospitalized children, particularly those in the PICU, are at high risk of developing delirium. Pediatric delirium often presents differently than that of adults. Children may be more likely to have a catatonia-like presentation, with general listlessness and paucity of speech. In turn, delirium in children is associated with complications such as increased length of stay, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and possible long-term neurodevelopmental issues.

May be used in both developmentally normal and delayed patients. Children with developmental delay are at higher risk of developing delirium than non-delayed children, and therefore should be monitored more closely for delirium symptoms.

Cornell assessment of pediatric delirium can be interpreted as:
CAPD Score	Delirium	Recommendation

≥9	Present	Investigate and treat underlying medical condition(s) causing delirium, consider interventions with parents and child life services, and/or consult to psychiatry or palliative care as appropriate, consider medications like melatonin or QUEtiapine (SEROquel) in select cases

<9	Absent	Continue usual care and monitoring">
