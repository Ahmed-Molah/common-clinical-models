			use = <"The Simplified Motor Score (SMS) has been suggested as a replacement for the GCS in the evaluation of patients for traumatic brain injury.

The Simplifed Motor Score (SMS) is defined as:

    Obeys commands=2
    Localizes to pain=1
    Withdrawals to pain or worse=0.

Score interpretation:

SMS score = 2 indicates low risk of need for intubation, neurosurgical intervention or mortality (like a GCS of 14-15).
 SMS of <2 indicate a significantly increased risk of having a significant traumatic brain injury and prompt evaluation and head CT imaging is indicated for these patients.
