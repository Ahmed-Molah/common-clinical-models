Low risk patients score 0-3 with less than 2% risk of MACE (All-cause mortality myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization) at 6 weeks.
High risk patients score > 3 with > 2% risk that rises exponentially. See below:

Risk of adverse cardiac event:

0-3: 0.9-1.7% - These patients could be discharged. 

4-6: 12-16.6% - These patients need to be admitted to the hospital. 

≥7: 50-65% - These patients are candidates for early invasive measures. ">
