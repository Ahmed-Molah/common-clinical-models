			purpose = <"The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system reports on the severity of pancreatic cancer based on tumor, lymph node and metastasis characteristics. The characteristics of the size of the tumour, the extent of spread to local lymph nodes and body organs. These aspects are captured in 3 ways that make up the mnemonic TNM: T: Tumour size; N: Number of regional lymph nodes affected and M: whether the cancer has spread/metastasised beyond the primary organ and regional nodes. Each major category is further subdivided to help classify the picture further. These subdivisions are given suffixes or numbered as shown below.">
			use = <"T
TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
T0: No evidence of primary tumor
Tis: Carcinoma in situ
T1: Tumor limited to pancreas, ≤2 cm in greatest dimension
T2: Tumor limited to pancreas, >2 cm in greatest dimension
T3: Tumor extends beyond pancreas but without involving celiac axis or Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA)
T4: Tumor involves celiac axis or SMA (unresectable primary)

N:

NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
N1: Regional lymph node metastasis

M:

M0: No distant metastasis
M1: Distant metastasis

The staging combines the 3 subdivisions as described above to produce classifications shown:

Stage 0: TisN0M0
The tumor is confined to the top layers
of pancreatic duct cells and has not
invaded deeper tissues. It has not
spread outside of the pancreas. These
tumors are sometimes referred to as
pancreatic carcinoma in situ or
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia III
(PanIn III).

Stage IA: T1N0M0
The tumor is confined to the pancreas
and is 2 cm across or smaller (T1). The
cancer has not spread to nearby lymph
nodes (N0) or distant sites (M0).

Stage IB: T2N0M0
The tumor is confined to the pancreas
and is larger than 2 cm across (T2). The
cancer has not spread to nearby lymph
nodes (N0) or distant sites (M0).

Stage IIA: T3N0M0
The tumor is growing outside the
pancreas but not into major blood
vessels or nerves (T3). The cancer has
not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0)
or distant sites (M0).

Stage IIB: T1-T3N1M0
The tumor is either confined to the
pancreas or growing outside the
pancreas but not into major blood
vessels or nerves (T1-T3). The cancer
has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N1)
but not to distant sites (M0).

Stage III: T4AnyNM1
The tumor is growing outside the
pancreas and into nearby major blood
vessels or nerves (T4). The cancer may
or may not have spread to nearby
lymph nodes (Any N). It has not spread
to distant sites (M0).

Stage IV: AnyTAnyNM1
The cancer has spread to distant sites
(M1).
