			use = <"Use in patients with an intracranial pressure monitoring device. Use in supine patients with elevated intracranial pressure (e.g. from hemorrhage, edema, mass).

The celebral perfusion pressure is calculated with the following formula: 
CPP = MAP – ICP
Where MAP=mean arterial pressure and ICP=intercranial pressure. 

Requires invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. 

Clinicians must address both the patient’s CPP and ICP. For example, a patient could have a normal calculated CPP, but if the ICP is significantly elevated, it must be treated.

The definition of normal ICP changes with posture and age. It also varies slightly depending on which data are applied. Therefore, it is important to be aware of local practice guidelines when applying this calculator. ">
