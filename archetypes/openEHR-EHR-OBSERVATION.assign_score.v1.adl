			purpose = <"ASSIGN is a 10 year cardiovascular risk score which was developed to identify and prioritise disease-free individuals who have been assessed to be of high risk of developing cardiovascular disease in a ten-year period. ">
			use = <"The score is based on historical data and is a number between 0 and 99 which represents a percentage at 10-years of developing a cardiovascular disease (including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease (inc. transient ischemic attacks)) in individuals who are currently disease-free.

The ASSIGN score extends on the SIGN score by taking into account the individual's postcode (an approximation of the social economic status of the person) into account - mapped to the SIMD (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2012) and is thus related to the Scottish population [a similar mapping to other regions can be done in order to use ASSIGN elsewhere.]

The ASSIGN score risk factors are:

    older age group
    men > women
    poorer neighbourhoods
    family history (coronary disease or stroke)
    diabetes mellitus of target
    rheumatoid arthritis of target
    tobacco smoking (cigarettes, pipe tobacco, or cigars)
    the blood pressure reading
    the blood total cholesterol reading
    the blood HDL-cholesterol reading

All the risk factors are combined to give a score between 1 and 99. The calculation used is based on a rather long formula involving many different coefficients related to risk. The calculation is based on [4]. The higher the score, the higher the risk of cardiovascular disease.
An ASSIGN score of > 20 is high and identifies individuals of high risk of cardiovascular disease allowing for timely intervention.">

Readings of blood pressure and cholesterol must not be input without due attention to the medication used (if any) to reduce blood pressure and/or cholesterol.
Only for individuals in Scotland (unless postcode mapping is also adjusted to the new region - or SIGN is used instead)">
