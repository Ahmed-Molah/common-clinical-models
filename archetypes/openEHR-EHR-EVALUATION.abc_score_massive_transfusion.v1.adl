			purpose = <"To predict the need for massive transfusion of blood (and blood products) in acutely injured patients at initial assessment using simple clinical and bedside criteria.">
			use = <"To record the assessment of ABC score for massive transfusion. The score is based on presence or absence of its component variables: penetrating mechanism of injury, arrival systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less, arrival heart rate of 120 bpm or greater, and positive FAST (focused assessment with sonography in trauma). The presence of any variable contributes one point to the total score giving a minimum score of 0 and a maximum possible score of 4. A score of 2 or greater is likely to require massive transfusion.
ABC score	      Massive transfusion probability
0	      Unlikely – 1%
1	      Unlikely – 10%
2	      Likely – 41%
3	      Likely – 48%
4	      Highly likely – 100%
Score data is stored in a separate observation archetype: openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.abc_score_massive_transfusion.v1.
Massive transfusion is defined as 10 units or more of packed red blood cells in 24hrs or 5 units of packed red blood cells over 3 hours.">
