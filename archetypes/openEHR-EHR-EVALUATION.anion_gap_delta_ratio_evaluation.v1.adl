			use = <"There are many varying differential diagnoses based on the type of anion gap acidosis states. The delta ratio and corrected anion gap (for serum albumin) helps in this differentiation.

The delta ratio helps to evaluate whether there is a mixed acid-base picture in the presence of an anion gap acidosis. The interpretation is shown below:

Delta Ratio Interpretation:

Delta Ratio... 	Suggests...
< 0.4 	                   Hyperchloremic normal anion gap acidosis
< 1 	                   High AG & normal AG acidosis
1 to 2 	                   Pure Anion Gap Acidosis
                                      Lactic acidosis: average value 1.6
                                      DKA more likely to have a ratio closer to 1 due to urine ketone loss
> 2 	                    High AG acidosis and a concurrent metabolic alkalosis or a pre-existing compensated respiratory acidosis

Also a corrected Anion Gap that is higher than 1 mEq/L (mmol/L) in comparison to a non-corrected anion gap, is indicative of a high anion gap acidosis
