			purpose = <"To quantify 24-hour proteinuria with protein/creatinine ratio from a single urine sample. The Urinary Protein Excretion Estimation avoids problems such as time consuming urine collection, inconveniences for patients and collection errors. Detecting an increase in protein excretion has both diagnostic and prognostic value in initial detection and confirmation of renal disease. Quantifying proteinuria can also help assess effectiveness of therapy and progression of disease.">

			use = <"Use for patients in whom renal disease is suspected (to rule out), patients with known renal disease (to assess progression) and patients with low-grade proteinuria and otherwise intact renal function (to monitor).
