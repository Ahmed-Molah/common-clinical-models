			purpose = <"Pain Score (EDACS) provides a method to identify patients with a low risk of a major cardiac adverse event or possible acute coronary syndrom (ACS). The addition of a couple of variables, the extended EDACS, EDACS-ADP (accelerated diagnostic protocol) helps to ascertain whether they might be suitable for early discharge.">
			use = <"The EDACS- ADP extends on the EDAC score to provide  a fast evaluation of the risk a major cardiac adverse event or possible acute coronary syndrom (ACS). This uses the EDACS score and requires the additonal ADP elements to stratify the risk between low and not low risk: 

Low Risk Cohort:

EDACS < 16 and
If EKG shows no new ischemia and 0h and 2h troponin both negative

Recommendation: safe for discharge to early outpatient follow-up investigation (or proceed to earlier inpatient testing).

Not Low Risk Cohort:

EDACS ≥16 or EKG shows new ischemia 0h or 2h troponin positive

Recommendation: Proceed with usual care with further observation and delayed troponin.

Management

    For low-risk patients: consider other causes of chest pain due to aortic, esophageal, pulmonary, cardiac, and abdominal, and muskuloskeletal sources prior to discharge.
    For non-low-risk patients: Treat as per usual chest pain protocols, including but not limited to consideration of aspirin, nitroglycerin, and serial EKGs and biomarkers at minimum.
