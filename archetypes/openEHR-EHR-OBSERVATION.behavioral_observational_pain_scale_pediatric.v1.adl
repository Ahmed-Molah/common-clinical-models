			use = <"The BOPS requires close and attentive clinical evaluation of facial expressions, vocalization and body language.

Frequency of performing pain assessments:
•	Every 3 hours
•	15-20 minutes after IV administration of analgesics
•	30-45 minutes after oral/rectal administration

Consider analgesia for scores ≥ 3.

0-2 points: Minimal or no pain: Consider reassessing after 30 minutes.
≥3 points: Significant pain present: Consider analgesia and reassess afterward.
