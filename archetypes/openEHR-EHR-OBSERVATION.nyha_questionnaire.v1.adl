			purpose = <"The NYHA classification: is used to classify patients into one of 4 categories each across patient symptoms and objective assessment related to their limitations, if any, during physical activity. This assessment can be made by posing questions with 4 alternatives for each of the two classifications: Patient symptoms (functional capacity) and Objective assessment.">
			use = <"The NYHA classification: is used to classify heart failure patients into one of 4 categories across patient symptoms and objective assessment related to their limitations, if any, during physical activity.

Classes of patient symptoms are:

Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).

Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).

Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea

Class IV: Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.


Classes of Objective Assessment are:

Class A: No objective evidence of cardiovascular disease. No symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity.

Class B: Objective evidence of minimal cardiovascular disease. Mild symptoms and slight limitation during ordinary activity. Comfortable at rest.

Class C: Objective evidence of moderately severe cardiovascular disease. Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity. Comfortable only at rest.

Class D: Objective evidence of severe cardiovascular disease. Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest.
