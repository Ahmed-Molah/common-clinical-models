					description = <"Modified Norton Scale (MNS) is a risk assessment tool to evaluate a person's risk of developing pressure ulcers. It assesses 7 mental and physical variables, each with a possible response scored 1 (worst possible), 2, 3, or 4 (best possible) for a maximum total score of 28 and a minimum of 7. Lower scores mean a greater risk for developing pressure ulcers. Patients with a total score of ≤9 = very high risk, 10-14 = high risk,15-19 = intermediate risk and ≥20 = low risk. Note that the Modified Norton Scale should be used as a complement to clinical judgment.">
