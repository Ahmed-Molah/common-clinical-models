			use = <"Use to record data about an individual's acute gout arthritis score, and determine the need for further joint fluid analysis based on 7 variables: sex (2 points if male), previous report of arthritis (2 points if present), onset within 1 day (0.5 points if present), joint redness (1 point if present), involvement of 1st metatarsophalangeal joint (2.5 points if present), cardiovascular disease (1.5 points if present) and serum uric acid level (3.5 points if >5.88 mg/dl OR >0.35 mmol/L OR >350 umol/L). 
A total score <=4 is unlikely to be gout (gout prevalence 2.2%), 
score >4 and <8 is indeterminate (gout prevalence 31.2%), 
and a score >=8 is likely to be gout (gout prevalence 80.4%). 
Synovial fluid analysis of the affected joint for monosodium urate (MSU) crystals is recommended in the indeterminate group.">
