			use = <"Use to evaluate the MEWS score.

The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) is based on five parameters easily controlled for through simple bedside examination:

- Respiration rate
- Systolic blood pressure
- Heart rate
- Level of consciousness (AVPU)
- Body temperature

A total score of ≥4p (or 3p in any one parameter) should result in higher level of care as it is consistent with deteriorating state of the patient and increased risk of cardiac arrest and need for intensive care. 

Several hospitals use locally modified versions of the instrument including urine output - the model can be adjusted to accommodate specific requests.">
