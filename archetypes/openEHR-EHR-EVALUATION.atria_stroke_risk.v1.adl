			purpose = <"To record the 1-year predicted risk of ischaemic stroke or other thromembolism (TE) in individuals with atrial fibrillation. ATRIA stroke risk score has been validated as performing better than the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc risk models and provides more accurate and reliable stroke risk prediction, as well as guides optimal anticoagulation decision-making, in individuals with atrial fibrillation.">
			use = <"Use to record the ATRIA stroke risk, as determined from the ATRIA stroke risk score.
A score of 0 - 5 predicts a risk of ischaemic stroke/TE less than 1% (low risk of stroke);
a score of 6 predicts 1 - <2% risk (intermediate risk of stroke); and
a score of >6 predicts >=2% risk (high risk of stroke).">

					description = <"ATRIA (anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation) stroke risk is the predicted risk of ischaemic stroke/thromboembolism (TE) in individuals with atrial fibrillation. It is derived from the ATRIA stroke risk score which is calculated from the sum of points assigned for the presence (or absence) of certain risk factors: previous stroke, age, sex, comorbidities (diabetes, congestive heart failure, hypertension), proteinuria, and eGFR < 45ml/min (or end stage renal disease). The ATRIA stroke risk score takes a value between 0 - 15, and it is from this score that ATRIA stroke risk is predicted. An ATRIA stroke risk score between 0 - 5 predicts a risk of ischaemic stroke/TE less than 1%; a score of 6 predicts 1 - <2% risk; and a score >6 predicts >=2% risk.">
