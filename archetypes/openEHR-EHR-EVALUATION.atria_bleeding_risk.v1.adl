			use = <"To record data for ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) bleeding risk, based on calculated ATRIA bleeding risk score (minimum score = 0 and maximum score = 10).
Score <4 = low risk (0.8%) of warfarin-associated hemorrhage, 
score of 4 = intermediate risk (2.6%) and 
score >4 = high risk (5.8%).
These risk categories are used by physicians to determine whether to commence warfarin anticoagulation, as well as during re-evaluation of anticoagulation therapy, in patients with atrial fibrillation. The actual risk score and related variables are stored in a separate observation archetype: openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.atria_bleeding_risk_score.v1.">

					description = <"A risk stratification assessment to predict warfarin-associated hemorrahge and guide physician decision-making regarding warfarin use in atrial fibrillation. It is based on the ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) bleeding risk score, and classifies individuals with atrial fibrillation as low, intermediate or high risk of major hemorrhage (fatal OR requiring ≥2 U of packed red blood cells OR hemorrhage into a critical anatomical site e.g intracranial or retroperitoneal) based on the presence of the following 5 easily assessable clinical variables: anemia, severe renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min or on dialysis), age ≥75 years, prior bleeding, and hypertension; that yield a minimum score = 0 and a maximum score = 10. Individuals with total score <4 are at low risk (0.8%) of warfarin-associated hemorrhage, score of 4 is intermediate risk (2.6 %) and score >4 is classified as high risk (5.8%). It has been validated as simple and effective particularly in predicting external hemorrhage risk, but is out-performed by HAS-BLED score, particularly in predicting risk of  internal hemorrhage.">
