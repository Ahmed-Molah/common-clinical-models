Management

Low risk of mortality (1.1%) or severe morbidity (1.5%) for a score of 0

Consider outpatient management of PE if clinically appropriate and social factors allow for it.
   
High risk of mortality (8.9%) or severe morbidity (2.7%) for a score of ≥ 1

Consider inpatient management and higher levels of care if clinically appropriate.">
