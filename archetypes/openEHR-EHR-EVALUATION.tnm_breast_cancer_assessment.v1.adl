			purpose = <"The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system reports on the severity of breast cancer based on tumor, lymph node and metastasis characteristics. The characteristics of the size of the tumour, the extent of spread to local lymph nodes and body organs. These aspects are captured in 3 ways that make up the mnemonic TNM: T: Tumour size; N: Number of regional lymph nodes affected and M: whether the cancer has spread/metastasised beyond the primary organ and regional nodes. Each major category is further subdivided to help classify the picture further. These subdivisions are given suffixes or numbered as shown below.">
