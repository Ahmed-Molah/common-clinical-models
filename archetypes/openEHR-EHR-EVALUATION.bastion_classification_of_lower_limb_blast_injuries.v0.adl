			purpose = <"Stratifies blast injuries of lower limbs to guide treatment.">
			use = <"Intended use is for patients with lower extremity injuries after explosions resulting in complex blast wounds. The constellation of injuries may include blunt or crush injuries, traumatic amputations, and compartment syndrome, as well as associated neurologic, thoracic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary injuries. The primary aim of the proposed classification is to provide a pragmatic, comprehensive, and clinically relevant system to better facilitate the transfer of information.

Recommendation:
1: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Debridement ± plaster of paris (PoP) splintage. Method of vascular control: None required
1S: Initial debridement and/or amputation: PoP splintage ± debridement. Method of vascular control: At most, tourniquet application
2: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Most likely low or high transtibial amputation. Method of vascular control: Tourniquet at any level; 1 had intraperitoneal iliac vessel control
2S: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Combination of debridement, PoP splintage, and external-fixation. Method of vascular control: At most, tourniquet application
3: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Most likely through-knee or low transfemoral amputation. Method of vascular control: Tourniquet; may require intra- or less commonly extra-peritoneal vessel control
3S: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Majority required debridement only; also included PoP splintage, external-fixation, or low transfemoral amputation. Method of vascular control: Tourniquet at any level; may require extra- or intra-peritoneal iliac vessel control
4: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Most likely high transfemoral amputation. Method of vascular control: Intra-peritoneal iliac vessel control; less likely extra-peritoneal control
4S: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Majority required debridement only; also included high transtibial or transfemoral amputation. Method of vascular control: Tourniquet, femoral vessel or intra-peritoneal iliac vessel control
5: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Most likely high transfemoral amputation. Method of vascular control: Intra-peritoneal iliac vessel control; less likely extra-peritoneal control or tourniquet
5S: Initial debridement and/or amputation: Debridement only. Method of vascular control: Extra-peritoneal vessel control">
