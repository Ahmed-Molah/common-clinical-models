			purpose = <"For evaluating the pre-test probability of DVT. By utilizing the Wells’ DVT criteria, the physician can identify patients with low risk of  DVT, thereby avoiding unnecessary additional clinical investigations. Two points or greater indicates high probability of DVT.">
			use = <"The Wells' Criteria should only be applied after a thorough history and physical examination resulting in a suspicion of DVT. The protocol can be implemented in outpatient as well as emergency department settings. 

A low risk score (<2 points) along with a negative test result for d-dimer excludes the need for further examination with ultrasound. 

The score is composed of seven weighted criteria:

- Active cancer (treatment or palliation within 6 months)
- Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilisation of the lower extremity
- Bedridden recently ≥3 days or major surgery within 12 weeks
- Localized tenderness along the deep venous system
- Entire leg swollen
- Calf swelling (>3 cm compared to the other leg)
- Pitting edema (confined to symptomatic leg)
- Collateral (nonvaricose) superficial veins
- Previously documented DVT
- Alternative diagnosis to DVT at least as likely

The maximum score is eight points. Two points or greater  indicates high probability of DVT. ">
