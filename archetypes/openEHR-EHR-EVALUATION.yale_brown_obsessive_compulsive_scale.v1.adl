			use = <"To determine the severity of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. It is based on the Y-BOCS score which assesses the occurence of 10 items; (5 items related to obsessions and 5 items related to compulsons) each rated from 0 = no symptoms to 4 = extreme symptoms, yielding a minimum score = 0 and a maximum score = 40. Y-BOCS scores in the range of,
0 - 7 are indicative of little or no OCD symptoms
8 - 15 are indicative of mild OCD symptoms
16 - 23 are indicative of moderate OCD symptoms
24 - 31 are inicative of severe OCD symptoms
32 - 40 are indicative of extreme OCD symptoms.
