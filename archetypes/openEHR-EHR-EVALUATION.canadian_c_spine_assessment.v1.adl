Low risk - no radiography needed.

High Risk

•High risk patient. C-Spine cannot be cleared clinically by the initial criteria (Age ≥ 65 years, extremity paresthesias or dangerous mechanism*). Imaging is recommended.

*Dangerous mechanism:

Fall from elevation >= 3 feet/5 stairs
Axial load to head e.g. diving
MVC (motor vehicle collision) high speed (>100km/hr), rollover, ejection
Motorized recreational vehicles
Bicycle collision

•High risk patient due to lack of low-risk criteria**. C-Spine cannot be cleared clinically by these criteria. Imaging is recommended.

**Low risk list:
Sitting position in the ED
Ambulatory at any time
Delayed (not immediate onset) neck pain
No midline tenderness. 
Simple rear-end motor vehicle collision (MVC) not simple if: pushed into traffic, hit by bus/large truck, rollover, hit by high-speed vehicle.


•High risk patient due to inability to rotate neck 45 degrees left AND right. C-Spine cannot be cleared clinically by these criteria. Imaging is recommended.
