			use = <"Use in critically ill pediatric patients aged 0-21 years to help to identify signs to monitor fo delirium. As in adults, hospitalized children, particularly those in the PICU, are at high risk of developing delirium. Pediatric delirium often presents differently than that of adults. Children may be more likely to have a catatonia-like presentation, with general listlessness and paucity of speech. In turn, delirium in children is associated with complications such as increased length of stay, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and possible long-term neurodevelopmental issues.

May be used in both developmentally normal and delayed patients. Children with developmental delay are at higher risk of developing delirium than non-delayed children, and therefore should be monitored more closely for delirium symptoms.

The signs to be looked for depends on the age of the patient. There are predefined age categories (newborn, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 28 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years) use the closest to the patient's age.">
