			purpose = <"The Self-administered comorbidity questionnaire (SCQ) helps to provide a prediction of psychometric properties of patients with comorbidities. It is associated health status and health care utilization after 1 year.">
			use = <"The SCQ provides an efficient method to help assess comorbid conditions in clinical and health services research and in settings where medical records are not easily available.
The self-administered questionnaire asks 12 questions about conditions in 3 parts:

1) Whether the patient has the condition
2) Whether they receive treatment for the condition
3) Whether the condition limits their activities

Each of the 3 parts scores either 0 (no) or 1 (yes).

There are then upto 3 optional additional questions that the patient can fill in for any condition not already mentioned to which the above 3 parts also apply. As Osteoarthritis is often hard to distinguish with rheumatoid arthritis for patients, therefore, it is not scored but added in with the osteoarthritis question.

The maximum score possible is thus 45 but if no optional conditions are added, the score maximum is 36.

Comorbid conditions listed are:

Heart disease
High blood pressure
Lung disease
Diabetes
Ulcer or stomach disease
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Anaemia or other blood disease
Cancer
Depression
Osteoarthritis, degenerative arthritis
Back pain
