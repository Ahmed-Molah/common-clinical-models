			purpose = <"To record the result of assessment according to ACTION ICU Score for Intensive Care in NSTEMI(Non-ST elevated Myocardial Infarction) guideline.
ACTION ICU Score for Intensive Care in NSTEMI helps to predict the likelihood of complications requiring ICU care among patinets with NSTEMI.">
			use = <"Note: ACTION ICU Score is not yet prospectively validated.
ACTION ICU Score helps to predict the risk of NSTEMI complications and thus identifying patients who are initially stable but may later develop complications requiring a higher level of care, and may therefore help with disposition and avoiding failure to rescue.

ACTION ICU Score can be interpreted as follows:
ACTION ICU Score	Risk of complications requiring ICU care among initially uncomplicated patients with NSTEMI*

≤1	3.4%
2	4.9%
3	5.5%
4	6.9%
5	9.3%
6	12%
7	14.6%
8	17.4%
9	20.8%
10	23.3%
11	27.7%
12	31%
13	31.5%

Do not use for patients under 65 years as it is derived in patients ≥65 years old, and may not apply to younger patients.
Note that different institutions may use different thresholds for ICU admission.
