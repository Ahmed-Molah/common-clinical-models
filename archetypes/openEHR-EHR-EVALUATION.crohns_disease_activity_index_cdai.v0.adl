Note: for abdominal pain and general well-being ratings, this calculator uses an average rating per day over the past 7 days. For stools, use the total number of soft/liquid stools over the past 7 days. The answer of each criteria will be multiplied by a multiplier which will give points towards the final score.

Score interpretation:
-CDAI <150 is a marker of remission of Crohn’s disease
-CDAI >450 is a marker of severe Crohn's disease">
