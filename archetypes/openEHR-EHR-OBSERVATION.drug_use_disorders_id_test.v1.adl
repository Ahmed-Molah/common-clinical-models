			purpose = <"To identify individuals with drug-related problems as well as their drug-use patterns using a set of 11 psychometric indicators. Identifies drug-related problems in settings where individuals who use drugs may be encountered.">
			use = <"To record the DUDIT score as well as component data from responses to the 11 psychometric indicator questions. The first 9 questions are scored 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 while the 10th and 11th questions are scored 0, 2 or 4. Minimum DUDIT score = 0 (no drug-related problem) and maximum DUDIT score = 44 (extremely dependent on multiple drugs).
A list of drugs is available in the references and includes recreational drugs as well as sedatives, painkillers or other pills (medicines) taken in excess number or frequency than prescribed by the physician, taken to feel good or get 'high', taken from a relative or friend, bought from the 'black market', or stolen.
If a male client shows a score of 6 or more points, he probably has drug-related problems – either substance abuse/harmful use or dependence. A woman with a score of 2 or more points probably has drug-related problems. If a client (both sexes) shows a score of 25 points or more, it is highly probable that he or she is dependent on one or more drugs. 
DUDIT is both self-reported as well as interviewer assessed.">
