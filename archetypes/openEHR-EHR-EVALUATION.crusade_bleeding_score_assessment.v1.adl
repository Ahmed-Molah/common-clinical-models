			use = <"This tool allows for interpretation of the scores. The score identifies:

Very low risk (3.1% risk of major bleeding) as bleeding score ≤20, 
Low risk (5.5%) with a score range of 21-30
Moderate risk (8.5%) with a score range of 31-40
High risk (11.9%) with a score range of 41-50
Very high risk (19.5%) with scores >50.

Recommendations:

Very High Risk: Judicious use of anti-thrombotic and invasive therapies is prudent in this very high risk of bleeding group. 

High risk: Judicious use of anti-thrombotic and invasive therapies is prudent in this high risk of bleeding group. 

Moderate risk: Initiation of anti-thrombotic and invasive therapies should be considered and discussed with the patient as the benefits likely outweigh the risks.

Low Risk: Initiation of anti-thrombotic and invasive therapies should be considered as benefits likely outweigh the risks. 

Very Low Risk: Initiation of anti-thrombotic and invasive therapies is reasonable given a relatively low risk of major bleeding.">
