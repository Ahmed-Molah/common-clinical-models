			purpose = <"This Framingham Risk score is based on the 'Hard' Coronary Framingham outcomes model, which omits co-morbidities and is used to calculate an estimate of the risk of occurence of a heart attack within a 10 year period.">
			use = <"The score is calculated differently between males and females and is based on the total sum of 5 of the 7 individual variables with continuous variables discretized.

The scoring system sheets can be seen in (1). 
Score interpretations can be found in more detail on (2) As example for men:

Score of 5-6                               Relates to 2% 10 year CHD RIsk
Score of 12                                 Relates to 10% 10 year CHD Risk
Score of ≥17                              Relates to > 30% 10 year CHD Risk">

			misuse = <"The tool should be used with caution when applied to varying populations (as figures are based on the US population over many years). The tool should also be accompanied by other supporting evidence and clinical judgement when utilising the results.">
