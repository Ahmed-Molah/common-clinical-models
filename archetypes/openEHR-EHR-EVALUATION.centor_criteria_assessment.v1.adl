The modified Centor Criteria scoring system consists of several factors, each contributing points to the total score; 
- (Absence of) Cough 0-1
- Swollen/tender anterior cervical nodes 0-1
- Temperature >38° C 0-1
- Tonsillar exudate or swelling 0-1
- Age range, 45+ (-1), 15-44 (0), 3-14 (1)

The total score results in a recommendation. Throat culture or rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) is indicated for a score of two or more. As a rule, empiric antibiotic treatment should be preceded by testing.
