			purpose = <"A self-reported method to quantify depressive symptoms from patients across 16 multiple choice questions, which relate to 9 depression symptoms. ">
			use = <"The QIDS (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology) helps those patients whom either see themselves or whom may be seen by others as being depressed using a self-assessment method of scoring, mapping the extent of their feelings of depression over a 4 point scale and across 16 questions. 

These questions relate to 9 depression symptoms regarding sleep patterns, mood, appetite, weight fluctuations, worth, decision-making, suicidal thoughts, speed of thinking/gesturing/speaking, interest in other people and energy level.

The scoring system works, for the most part, in the usual way: by adding the individual scores as recorded by the patient for each question who fills it in as normal. However, for questions 1-4, 6-9, 15 and 16, only the highest score is recorded and added to the running total. Thus creating only 1 score for each of the 9 depression symptoms as described above. 

The score values span from 0 to 3 at each response, giving a max total score of 27 (3 multiplied by 9).

Score Interpretation is based on 5 grades of severity:

    â‰¤5 indicate no depression.
    6-10 indicate mild depression.
    11-15 indicate moderate depression.
    16-20 indicate severe depression">
