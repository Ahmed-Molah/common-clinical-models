Managment:

- For very low risk patients, consider routine surveillance.
- For low to intermediate-risk patients, consider localized treatment (surgery or radiation alone, brachytherapy with or without external-beam therapy).
- For intermediate to high-risk patients, consider multimodal therapy (surgery with radiation, or radiation therapy with hormonal therapy).
- For very high-risk patients, consider either multimodal therapy OR hormonal therapy, and clinical trial enrollment.
