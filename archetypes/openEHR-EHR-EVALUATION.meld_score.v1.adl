			purpose = <"To assess 90-day mortality rates in individuals with end-stage liver disease, based on the calculate MELD score.">
			use = <"To record the assessment of 90-day mortality rate, based on the calculated MELD score that considers serum creatinine, total serum bilirubin, and serum sodium concentrations; the International Normalized Ratio for prothrombin time (INR); and whether or not the individual has had at least two dialysis sessions or 24hrs of continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) in the last week before serum creatinine was measured.

Original MELD (oMELD) score = 9.57 * ln(creatinine, mg/dL) + 3.78 * ln(bilirubin, mg/dL) + 11.20 * ln(INR) + 6.43; a positive history of dialysis automatically defaults serum creatinine concentration to 4 mg/dl.
MELD score = oMELD + [1.32 * (137-Na)] – [0.033 * oMELD * (137-Na)]; based on a normal serum sodium concentration of 125-137 mmol/L.
MELD score is stored in a separate observation archetype: openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.meld_score.v1. 
MELD score is also accurate in predicting survival in patients with variceal bleeding, determining mortality in patients with cirrhosis who develop infections, predicting mortality in patients with fulminant hepatic failure, alcoholic hepatitis and other forms of chronic liver disease, as well as in prioritizing recipients of liver transplantation.

90-day mortality rates based on MELD score are: 
score = 40 (71.3% mortality); 
score = 30-39 (52.6% mortality); 
score = 20-29 (19.6% mortality); 
score = 10-19 (6.0% mortality) and 
score = 9 or less (1.9% mortality).">

					description = <"Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease. It is a reliable way of estimating disease severity, determining prognosis, and assigning organ allocation priority in patients with end-stage liver disease. The score is calculated from a regression equation that includes serum sodium, creatinine and total bilirubin concentrations, the International Normalized Ratio for prothrombin time (INR) and whether or not the individual has had at least two dialysis sessions in the last week before serum creatinine was measured. MELD score is considered as good as the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score in predicting short-term mortality in end-stage liver disease, as well as an accurate predictor of survival in patients with variceal bleeding, mortality in patients with cirrhosis who develop infections, mortality in patients with fulminant hepatic failure, alcoholic hepatitis and other forms of chronic liver disease. 90-day mortality rates based on MELD score are: score = 40 (71.3% mortality); score = 30-39 (52.6% mortality); score = 20-29 (19.6% mortality); score = 10-19 (6.0% mortality) and score = 9 or less (1.9% mortality).">
