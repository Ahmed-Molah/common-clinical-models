			purpose = <"The 4 Ts (the 4 parts of the tool starting with \"T\") score helps to stratify patients at risk of HIT (Heparin induced thrombocytopenia) among those at risk of thrombocytopen ia overall and who are taking heparin-based substances.">
			use = <"Those patients in the low risk group do not require further investigation for HIT.
Those patients in the intermediate or high risk groups should warrant further investigation and/or changing to other anti-coagulants without heparin.

Interpretation:
•≤3 points: low probability for HIT (≤5% in the original study).
• 4-5 points: intermediate probability (~14% probability of HIT).
• 6-8 points: high probability (~64% probability of HIT).">

			misuse = <"Any positive scores should lead to further clinical evidence to provide further support to the result and so the tool should not be used on its own.">
