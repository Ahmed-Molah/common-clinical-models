			use = <"Use to store assessment data for CDAI which is based on 4 (four) input parameters: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), patient global assessment of disease activity (PtGDA), and provider global assessment of disease activity (PrGDA).
CDAI = TJC + SJC + PtGDA + PrGDA
CDAI score ≤ 2.8 = Remission
CDAI score > 2.8 - 10.0 = Low activity
CDAI score > 10.0 - 22.0 = Moderate activity
CDAI score > 22.0 = High activity.

CDAI correlates well with disease activity score (DAS28), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, and is useful in assessing disease activity, assessing response to therapy, assessing disease remission and in guiding therapy based on severity of the disease. A CDAI reduction by 6.5 represents a moderate improvement. CDAI data is stored in a separate observation archetype: openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.clinical_disease_activity_index.v1">

					description = <"Clinical disease activity index (CDAI) is a composite score for assessing disease activity in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is the numerical sum of four parameters: the number of tender (0 - 28) and swollen (0 - 28) joints the patient has, and the patient and physician global assessment of disease activity (on a visual analogue scale 0.0 -10.0). The disease is in remission with CDAI score ≤ 2.8; low activity > 2.8 - 10.0; moderate activity > 10.0 - 22.0 and high activity > 22.0. It is similar to simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and correlates well with disease activity score (DAS28), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. A CDAI reduction by 6.5 represents a moderate improvement.">
