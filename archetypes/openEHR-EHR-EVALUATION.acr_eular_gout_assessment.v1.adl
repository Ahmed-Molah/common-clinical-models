			purpose = <"This tool helps to differentiate between those patients with and those without Gout while reducing the need to assess synovial fluid through testing, especially if this is unavailable.">
			use = <"Use with patients with mono or oligoarthritis of unclear etiology or when gout is part of the differential diagnosis.

Can be used when synovial fluid testing is not available.

There are  3 levels or steps of criteria to get passed with the first 2 steps unscored but which lead to a definite classification or to allow further questioning to define classification further:

 Step 1 – Entry criterion:

≥1 episode of swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint/bursa

Step 2 – Sufficient criterion:

Presence of Monosodium Urate (MSU) crystals in a symptomatic joint, bursa, or tophus

Step 3: Classification criteria (scored) with a range of -6 to 23 with 8 sections with various scores.

A threshold score of ≥8 classifies an individual as having gout.
