			purpose = <"Provides a method to exclude knee x-rays via the Pittsburgh rules for patients whom haven't had prior knee surgery or emergency department evaluation, with an acute knee injury in the past 7 days.">
			use = <"The tool utilises 4 yes/no questions regarding a trauma mechanism (blunt or fall), an age range and the inability of bearing weight in the ED.

If the knee trauma mechanism has not been fulfilled or it has been fulfilled but no more than that, the Pittsburgh Knee Rules cannot be applied and the patient does not need a knee x-ray.

If the trauma mechanism criteria has been fulfilled, then at least one other criteria should be fulfilled to trigger the Pittsburgh Knee Rules and the recommendation for imaging is made.

Management

For non-serious non-bony injuries, crutches and knee imobilizers are recommended to help with movement">
