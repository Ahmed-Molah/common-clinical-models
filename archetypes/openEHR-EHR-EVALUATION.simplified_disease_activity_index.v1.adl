			purpose = <"To assess the calculated SDAI for assessing disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis.">
			use = <"Use to store assessment data for SDAI which is based on 5 (five) input parameters: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), patient global assessment of disease activity (PtGDA), provider global assessment of disease activity (PrGDA) and level of C-reactive protein (in mg/dl).
SDAI = TJC + SJC + PtGDA + PrGDA + CRP
SDAI score ≤ 3.3 = Remission
SDAI score > 3.3 - 11.0 = Low activity
SDAI score > 11.0 - 26.0 = Moderate activity
SDAI score > 26.0 = High activity.

SDAI correlates well with disease activity score (DAS28), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, and is useful in assessing disease activity, assessing response to therapy, assessing disease remission and in guiding therapy based on severity of the disease. An SDAI reduction by 7 represents a moderate improvement and a reduction more than 17 represents a major improvement. SDAI data is stored in a separate observation archetype: openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.simplified_disease_activity_index.v1">

					description = <"Simplified disease activity index (SDAI) is a composite score for assessing disease activity in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is the numerical sum of five parameters: the number of tender (0 - 28) and swollen (0 - 28) joints the patient has, the patient and physician global assessment of disease activity (on a visual analogue scale 0.0 -10.0), and the patient's circulating level of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). The disease is in remission with SDAI score ≤ 3.3; low activity > 3.3 - 11.0; moderate activity > 11.0 - 26.0 and high activity > 26.0. It is similar to clinical disease activity index (CDAI), without the need for CRP concentration and it correlates well with disease activity score (DAS28), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. An SDAI reduction by 7 represents a moderate improvement and a reduction more than 17 represents a major improvement.">
