			use = <"Management follows a 3 or 2 tier model with the latter related to likely or unlikely PE with this grouping leading to testing by either d-Dimer or CTA (CT angiogram).

3 Tier Model:

Score 0-1: Low Risk (1.3% risk prevalence)
Recomendation: consider d-dimer testing to rule out PE or a rule out criteria such as PERC
If dimer is negative - consider ceasing the work-up
if dimer is positive - consider CTA

Score 2-6: Moderate Risk (16.2% risk prevalence)
Recommendation: consider high sensitivity d-dimer testing or CTA
If dimer is negative - consider ceasing the work-up
if dimer is positive - consider CTA

Score >6: High Risk (37.5% risk prevalence)
Recommendation: d-dimer testing is not recommended - consider CTA

2 Tier Model:

Score ≤4: PE Unlikely (with d-dimer) (12.1% risk incidence)
Recommendation: consider high sensitivity d-dimer testing
If dimer is negative - consider ceasing the work-up
if dimer is positive - consider CTA

Score ≥5: PE Likely (with CTA) (37.1% risk incidence)
Recommendation: consider CTA testing">
