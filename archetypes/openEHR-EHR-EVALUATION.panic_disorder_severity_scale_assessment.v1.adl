Thus the raw score ranges from 0 to 28 and the composite scores from 0 to 4.">
			use = <"The scores are interpreted by grouping the patients into those with or those without agoraphobia in the following ways:

Without Agoraphobia:
Normal: 0-1 ; Bordeline: 2-5 ; Slightly ill: 6-9 ; Moderately ill: 10-13 ; Markedly ill: >= 14

With Agoraphobia:
Normal: 0-2 ; Bordeline: 3-7 ; Slightly ill: 8-10 ; Moderately ill: 11-15 ; Markedly ill: >= 16">
