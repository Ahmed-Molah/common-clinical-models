			use = <"It is used to assess the patients and detect the presence of overt and non overt DIC. THis scoring sysyem can be used in patients dignosed to have an underlying condition that can lead to the development of DIC. 

According to the Scoring system, if the total score is <5, it is suggestive of non-overt DIC and the scoring need to be repeated in next 1-2 days. If the total score is >= 5, then it is compatible with Overt DIC and the score needs to be repeated daily. ">

			misuse = <"It should not be used when one or more components are missing during the process of scoring.

Other reasons for excessive bleeding, for instance due to liver dysfunction should be ruled out by doing necessary tests and should not be solely dependent on this scoring system.
