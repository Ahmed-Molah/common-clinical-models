			use = <"Risk grading follows the following structure:

0-1 points: 5% risk at 14 days of all-cause mortality,
new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.

2 points: 8% risk at 14 days of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.

3 points: 13% risk at 14 days of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.

4 points: 20% risk at 14 days of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.

5 points: 26% risk at 14 days of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.
