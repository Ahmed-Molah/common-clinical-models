			purpose = <"The DSM criteria for ADHD requires the presence of current symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity in the past 6 months.
Thus this 18 part questionnaire is divded into groups that relate to these aspects.">
			use = <"The first part consisting of 6 questions - Part A - acts as a screening tool with the remaining 12 questions in Part B helping to explore the issues deeper. 

The detection of adult ADHD is notoriously difficult and often based on whether the individual had childhood symptoms. This tool is able to assess the possibility regardless of a previous history. This tool may, however, alert the clinician to asking for a possible past history as the patient may have been undiagnosed as having ADHD as a child.

Part A is normally marked out of 6 and starts at 0. Some marking systems separate out the selections among the five possibilities of response:

Never 
Rarely 
Sometimes 
Often 
Very often

This tool replicates this separation, so the total marks in Part A ranges from 0 to 24
A similar convention is used in Part B over the 12 questions, with overall score range of between 0 and 48 and a maximum score of 72 across both parts..

A score of <= 13 is indicative of no ADHD and >= 13 is indicative of ADHD warranting further investigation and a score of >= 8 in part B. However, a score >=13 in Part A on it's own is able to trigger the need to run further tests on its own. The scores are, however, distributed differently for different questions. This is depicted visually on the form itself, where sometimes the score of 2 (Sometimes) and the score of 3 (Often) is used as the threshold that demarcates between ADHD and non-ADHD. Please refer to (3). Score interpretation must thus follow this convention.">
