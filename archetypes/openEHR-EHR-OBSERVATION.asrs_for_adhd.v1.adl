			purpose = <"The DSM criteria for ADHD requires the presence of current symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity in the past 6 months.
Thus this 18 part questionnaire is divded into groups that relate to these aspects.">
			use = <"The first part consisting of 6 questions - Part A - acts as a screening tool with the remaining 12 questions in Part B helping to explore the issues deeper. 

The detection of adult ADHD is notoriously difficult and often based on whether the individual had childhood symptoms. This tool is able to assess the possibility regardless of a previous history. This tool may, however, alert the clinician to asking for a possible past history as the patient may have been undiagnosed as having ADHD as a child.

Part A is marked out of 6 and starts at 0. Some marking systems separate out the selections among the five possibilities of response:

Never Rarely Sometimes Often Very often

But in this archetype, depending on the question, the weighting for some of the selections are the same as others and thus there is actually a binary separation - those in one group and those in the other with only the response type being used to guide the division. 

For example, the question: \"How often do you have trouble wrapping up the final details of a project, once the challenging parts have been done?\" has the same score weight for Never and Rarely, and so the respondent can reply to this part if they feel the response is either of those. Similarly, the weighted scores for responding as Sometimes, Often, Very Often is also the same for each of those responses and so the respondent can pick this alternative if any of those responses apply.

A similar convention is used in Part B over the 12 questions, with overall score range of between 0 and 12.

A score of >= 4 is indicative of ADHD warranting further investigation and this is across both parts, A and B. However, a score >= 4 in Part A on it's own is able to trigger the need to run further tests on its own.">
