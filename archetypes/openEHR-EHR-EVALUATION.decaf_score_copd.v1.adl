			purpose = <"To predict in-hospital mortality risk for patients admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD.">
			use = <"Can be used in patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD within the following criteria of patient:
- ≥35 years old,
- ≥10 pack-year smoking history
- with or without pneumonia, and
- preadmission evidence of airflow obstruction on spirometry (FEV₁/FVC <0.70).

The score is calculated based on the severity of the symptom measured using the Extended MRC (eMRC) Dyspnea Scale and the presence or absence of these findings in the initial examination at the time of admission:
- Eosinopenia (Eosinophils <0.05×10⁹/L)
- Acidemia (pH <7.30)
- Consolidation on Chest X-Ray
- Atrial fibrillation on the ECG and/or a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

The interpretation of the score are as follow:
- Low risk (score 0-1) patients may be appropriate for early supported discharge.
- High risk (score 3-6) patients may be appropriate for higher levels of care and/or addressing goals of care.
- Higher scores may correlate with increased length of stay.">
