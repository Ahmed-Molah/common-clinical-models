			use = <"A score from the raw questionnaire of > 0.36 relates to a 6 times higher risk of being admitted into a care home in the next 12 months as well as a 5 times risk of mortality. The scores can be categorised as shown:
Fit (eFI score 0 - 0.12) – People who have no or few long-term conditions that are usually well controlled. This group would mainly be independent in day to day living activities.

Mild frailty (eFI score 0.13 –0.24) – People who are slowing up in older age and may need help with personal activities of daily living such as finances, shopping, transportation.

Moderate Frailty (eFI score 0.25 –0.36) – People who have difficulties with outdoor activities and may have mobility problems or require help with activites such as washing and dressing.

Severe Frailty (eFI score > 0.36) – People who are often dependent for personal care and have a range of long-term conditions/multimorbidity. Some of this group may be medically stable but others can be unstable and at risk of dying within 6 -12 months.">
