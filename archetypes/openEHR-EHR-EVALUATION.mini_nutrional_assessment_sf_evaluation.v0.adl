			use = <"Use to evaluate the MNA-SF score on geriatric patients ≥ 65 years.
Maximum MNA-SF score possible is 14; 
≥12 points = normal (no need for further assessment) 
8 - 11 points = at risk of malnutrition 
<8 = malnourished
A score <12 requires further assessment and possible intervention.
If greater specificity is desired consider 10 points or below as possible malnutrition.">
