No validated scroing systems available for the prediciton of mRCC survival but there are three survival groups with associated median survival: 

Score interpretation:

Score 	Prognosis  	Median Survival
≤1 	Favorable  	43.2 months
2 	Intermediate 	22.5 months
≥3 	Poor 	                   7.8 months
