DLCN score < 3 = unlikely FH.
Molecular genetic testing and referral to a lipid specialist is strongly recommended in individuals with DLCN score > 5 and particularly those with xanthoma and/or high cholesterol plus a family history of premature coronary heart disease. Molecular genetic testing should also be offered to all first degree relatives of individuals with a confirmed causative mutation.

					description = <"The Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) score is derived from the responses to a set of 10 clinical and laboratory-based questions recommended by the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) for aiding the diagnosis of heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in adults. The criteria fall into five categories: family history (2 points), clinical history (2 points), physical examination findings (6 points), pre-treatment LDL cholesterol level (8 points) and presence of causative mutation on DNA analysis (8 points); minimum score = 0 and maximum score = 26. DLCN score >8 is ‘definite FH’, score 6 - 8 is ‘probable FH', score 3 - 5 is ‘possible FH’ and score <3 is ‘unlikely FH’.">
