When present each factor contributes one (1) additional point to the total score.\n\nTotal score ranges from 0-5 and is associated with a risk level, which is in turn associated with certain care level recommendations.\n* 0-1 points, low risk group. Consider home treatment. 30-day mortality: \u003c3 %.\n* 2 points, moderate risk group. Consider hospital admission. 30-day mortality: 9 %.\n* 3 points, severe risk group. Urgent hospital admission. 30-day mortality: 15-40 %.\n* 4-5 points, highest risk group. Urgent hospital admission, consider ICU admission. 30-day mortality: 15-40 %\n\n",
