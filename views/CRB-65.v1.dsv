When present each factor contributes one (1) additional point to the total score.\n\nTotal score ranges from 0-4 and is associated with a risk level, which is in turn associated with certain care level recommendations.\n* 0 points, low risk group. Consider home treatment. 30-day mortality: 1,2 %.\n* 1-2 points, moderate risk group. Consider hospital admission. 30-day mortality: 8,2 %.\n* 3-4 points, severe risk group. Urgent hospital admission, consider ICU admission. 30-day mortality: 31,3 %.",
