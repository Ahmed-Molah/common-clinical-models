        "use": "The QIDS (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology) helps those patients whom either see themselves or whom may be seen by others as being depressed using a self-assessment method of scoring, mapping the extent of their feelings of depression over a 4 point scale and across 16 questions. \n\nThese questions relate to 9 depression symptoms regarding sleep patterns, mood, appetite, weight fluctuations, worth, decision-making, suicidal thoughts, speed of thinking/gesturing/speaking, interest in other people and energy level.\n\nThe scoring system works, for the most part, in the usual way: by adding the individual scores as recorded by the patient for each question who fills it in as normal. However, for questions 1-4, 6-9, 15 and 16, only the highest score is recorded and added to the running total. Thus creating only 1 score for each of the 9 depression symptoms as described above. \n\nThe score values span from 0 to 3 at each response, giving a max total score of 27 (3 multiplied by 9).\n\nScore Interpretation is based on 5 grades of severity:\n\n    ≤5 indicate no depression.\n    6-10 indicate mild depression.\n    11-15 indicate moderate depression.\n    16-20 indicate severe depression",
