Patients with qSOFA score of ≥2 should be assessed for organ dysfunction (this includes lactate levels). Furthermore, the SOFA Score should be calculated for these patients and the standard interventions for sepsis should be used as treatment. \n\nA qSOFA score of \u003c2 is not associated with a high risk of poor prognosis, but it does not suggest that the subject of care is not a high risk patient.
