        "purpose": "To calculate the means and total score for the IES-R. Impact of event scale revised ( IES-R) is a 22-item self-report measure to assess subjective distress caused by traumatic events. Respondents are asked to select a specific stressful moment in life and then indicate how much they were distressed or bothered during the past seven days by each of the difficulties listed. Items are rated from 0(\\\"not at all\\\") to 4 (\\\"estremely\\\"). The score ranges from 0 to 88 and subscale scores can be used to calculate the intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal subscales. These subscales are measured in means. The maximum mean score on each of the three subscales is ‘4’, therefore the maximum ‘total mean’ IESR\nscore is 12. Lower scores are better. A total IES-R score of 33 or over from a theoretical maximum of 88 signifies the likely presence of PTSD.",
