It provides an estimate of survival time and likelihood of the patient requiring home assistance.",

        "use": "The Karnofsky performance status scale helps to give an estimate of survival time and likelihood of the patient requiring home assistance.\nThe scale ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 is a normal functional capcity and 0 is dead.\n\nThe tool asks a series of 10 questions each with a score of 10. Each score is associated with a level of functional ability and evaluation of the patient's functional disability/ability:\n\n0 - dead\n10 - 40: - Unable to care for self; requires equivalent of institutional or hospital care; disease may be progressing rapidly.\n50 - 70: - Unable to work; able to live at home and care for most personal needs; varying amount of assistance needed.\n80-100: - Able to carry on normal activity and to work; no special care needed.\n\nThe scores correlate with the % survival.\n",
