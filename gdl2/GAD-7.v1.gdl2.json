Also used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms and their change over time. May be used to screen individuals for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \r\n\r\nThe GAD-7 scale consists of 7 questions with answers scored on a 4-point Likert scale:\r\n(0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day). \r\n\r\nThe total score is the sum of the scores on all 7 items and gives a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 21. \r\nScores of 5, 10 and 15 are cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety respectively. Further evaluation of the individual is recommended with a total score of 10 or greater.",

Answers to the 7 questions are scored on a 4-point Likert scale: (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day), giving a minimum score = 0 and a maximum score = 28. Mild, moderate and severe anxiety are defined by scores of 5, 10 and 15 respectively. Individuals with score >= 10 require further evaluation."
