        "use": "Use in critically ill pediatric patients aged 0-21 years to help to identify signs to monitor fo delirium. As in adults, hospitalized children, particularly those in the PICU, are at high risk of developing delirium. Pediatric delirium often presents differently than that of adults. Children may be more likely to have a catatonia-like presentation, with general listlessness and paucity of speech. In turn, delirium in children is associated with complications such as increased length of stay, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and possible long-term neurodevelopmental issues.\n\nMay be used in both developmentally normal and delayed patients. Children with developmental delay are at higher risk of developing delirium than non-delayed children, and therefore should be monitored more closely for delirium symptoms.\n\nThe signs to be looked for depends on the age of the patient. There are predefined age categories (newborn, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 28 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years) use the closest to the patient's age.",
        "misuse": "Do not use in patients with Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) ≤-4 (deep sedation: no response to voice, but movement or eye opening to physical stimulation, or unarousable: no response to voice or physical stimulation).\nAdapt the categories to the development stage of the child. Signs to look for can be seen in the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium Signs guideline.",
