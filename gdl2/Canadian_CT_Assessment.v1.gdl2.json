If none of the variables in the first part are positively scored, the scores in the 2nd part are considered. If any score positively here, the  risk is then set at medium.\n\nThe 5 variables in the first part include:\n\nAge, evidence of skull fractures (0pen, depressed or basliar), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and episodes of vomiting. As each question in this section indciates a high risk of serious head injury, if any are answered positively, a CT should be performed.\n\nThe 2 variables in the Medium risk category are:\n\nEvidence of retrograde amnesia and a \\\"dangerous mechanism\\\" (see questions).\nIf any of these questions are answered positively, consider performing a CT scan due to the medium risk.\n\nIf neither part is scored positively, a CT is unnecessary.",
        "misuse": "A CT scan should be performed if any questions in the rule are answered positively.\nOnly use this tool with patients with LOC/Amnesia or changes in mental status and not with those <16 years of age, on blood thinners or patients who have had a  seizure after injury",
