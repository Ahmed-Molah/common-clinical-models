The first 9 questions are scored 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 while the 10th and 11th questions are scored 0, 2 or 4. Minimum DUDIT score = 0 (no drug-related problem) and maximum DUDIT score = 44 (extremely dependent on multiple drugs).\nA list of drugs is available in the references and includes recreational drugs as well as sedatives, painkillers or other pills (medicines) taken in excess number or frequency than prescribed by the physician, taken to feel good or get 'high', taken from a relative or friend, bought from the 'black market', or stolen.\nIf a male client shows a score of 6 or more points, he probably has drug-related problems – either substance abuse/harmful use or dependence. A woman with a score of 2 or more points probably has drug-related problems. If a client (both sexes) shows a score of 25 points or more, it is highly probable that he or she is dependent on one or more drugs. \nDUDIT is both self-reported as well as interviewer assessed and is scored by a separate application: DUDIT_score_Calculation.v1",

The test consists of 11 items or psychometric indicators which help assess drug-use patterns and various drug-related problems. The first 9 items are scored 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, while the 10th and 11th items (assessing \\\"harmful use\\\" and \\\"concern from others\\\" respectively) are scored 0, 2 or 4. Minimum total score = 0 (no drug-related problems) and maximum score = 44 (extremely dependent on multiple drugs). A male client with a score of 6 or more points probably has drug-related problems – either substance abuse/harmful use or dependence; while a woman with a score of 2 or more points probably has drug-related problems.
