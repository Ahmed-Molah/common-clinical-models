Each symptom and its associated degree of severity are assigned a score and the total abstinence score is determined by totalling the score assigned to each symptom over the scoring period (1). ",
        "misuse": "The neonatal abstinence syndrome scoring system was designed for term babies on four-hourly feeds and may therefore need modification for preterm infants. In a term infant scoring should be performed 30 minutes to one hour after a feed, before the baby falls asleep.  If necessary the infant should be awakened to elicit reflexes and behaviour, but if the infant is woken to be scored then diminished sleep after scoring should not be recorded. A crying infant should be soothed and quietened before assessing muscle tone, Moro reflex and respiratory rate(1). "
