A = W + RTS  --> where \"W\" (a weighted constant derived from regression analysis) = -3.5718
sP = 1 / 1 + e^-A  --> where \"e\" (Napier's constant) = 2.71828.

Higher RTS scores are associated with greater probability of survival, and RTS is calculated using RTS_Calculation.v1 GDL application.">

						description = <"Revised Trauma Score (RTS) is a physiologic score of injury severity performed at first patient contact following trauma, and it numerically summarizes assessments of circulatory (Systolic Blood Pressure), respiratory (Respiratory Rate) and central nervous system (Glasgow Coma Scale score) function, using coded and weighted forms of the three physiologic variables. RTS has high inter-rater ability and is used to quantify the severity of injury and predict survival, the latter using a logistic function that includes RTS and W-value (a constant derived from regression analysis).">
