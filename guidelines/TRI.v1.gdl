				purpose = <"TIMI Risk Index (TRI) is a fairly basic score that quantifies risk of STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarct) patients on fibrinolytics, in order to predict 30-day mortality.">
				use = <"The TRI is a basic continuous index calculator often used at presentation and is derived from measuring heart rate, systolic blood pressure and age of the patient, then calculated with this formula: 

(heart rate × [age/10]2/systolic blood pressure)

Divisions are across 5 \"Risk Index Quintiles\" groups and index score interpretations per group is shown:  

                                                           30-day mortality estimate (%)
Group 1: Risk index 12.5                              [0.8%]
Group 2: Risk Index >12.5-17.5                    [1.9%]
Group 3: Risk Index >17.5-22.5                    [3.3%] 
Group 4: Risk Index >22.5-30                       [7.3%]
Goup 5: Risk Index >30                                [17.4%]

The TRI is said to have an improved usage when predicting mortality rates in-hospital as well as long-term, for the general population of STEMI patients who have been treated with reperfusion therapy, as well as fibrinolytics or primary percutaneous coronary intervetion (PCI). 

The estimates of mortality procur benefits when assessing the level of care and treatment needed.
TRI provides 30-day mortality predictions validated against a 150,000 STEMI and a 300,000 NSTEMI patient registry.
