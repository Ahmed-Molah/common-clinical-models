Score interpretation:

A score of 0-1 is associated with 13-18% isolation of streptococcus (close to background carriage rates).
No antibiotics recommended.

A score of 2 is associated with 30-35% isolation of streptococcus.
Delayed antibiotic may be appropriate.

A score of 3 is associated with 39-48% isolation of streptococcus.
Delayed antibiotic may be appropriate.

A score of 4 or more is associated with 62-65% isolation of streptococcus.
Consider antibiotics if symptoms are severe or a short delayed prescribing strategy may be appropriate (48 hours).
