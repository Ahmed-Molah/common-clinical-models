				use = <"To help track and calculate an estimation of the due date of a pregnancy both forward from the LMP and backwards from the Due Date.

The tool uses either last menstrual period (LMP), current gestational age (GA), OR expected due date to determine the other two variables, plus estimated date of conception.

To calculate pregnancy due date from LMP:

    Determine last date of LMP.
    Add 40 weeks to the date.
    Add another 7 days to the date 40 weeks from the LMP. (OR use the First day of the Last Menstrual Period as has been done here)
