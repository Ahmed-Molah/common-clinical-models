Also for use to calculate albumin excretion rate (AER) which is approximately equal to the albumin:creatinine ratio, but with unit: mg/24hrs.
To obtain ACR in mg/mmol, divide ACR in mg/g by 10.

For use in concert with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to stage and evaluate the risk of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).">
