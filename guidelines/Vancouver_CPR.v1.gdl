If all answered \"no\" go to step 2

Step 2:  If the following question is answered \"yes\" - risk is low - discharge patient

    Does palpation reproduce pain?

If answer is \"no\" continue to Step 3

Step 3: If any of the below are answered \"yes\" - do not discharge

    Age ≥ 50?
    Does pain radiate to neck, jaw, or left arm

If all are \"no\"- it is safe to discharge the patient.">
